    <p>Today, I'm doing some array cardio. I'm actually following <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-loops-and-arrays#assignment">The Odin Project</a> and I'm at the part where I've forked /cloned the <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30">JavaScript30 repository</a>. As I was going through the array methods exercises portion, I took a detour and began going through the MDN <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting">Dynamic Scripting with JavaScript</a>. The language is looking less intimidating to me, and the more I practice the more I see how the logic works. It also feels really good to be able to read and understand JS and tweak small portions. When it comes to creating JS solutions from scratch, I have a LONG way to go though. I'm still trying to figure out how to translate the example given in the docs to something more complex. But I guess the magic is in learning how to learn.
I think if I keep at it every day, I will be able to finish the TOP curriculum by the end of 2025....At least that was the goal I set out to complete a year ago.ü•≤</p>
<p>For motivation, I've been listening to Brian Jinney's podcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@brianjenney/videos">Develop Yourself</a>. I relate to this guy because of past struggles with fucking around and finding out in my 20s and my addiction and recovery journey. He talks about how he had to give up playing Angry Birds, my current addition, in order to become a better developer and I gotta admit I felt totally called out in this moment. Like, thanks universe.
Anyway, better get back to that cardio.</p>
