Welcome, happy to have you here! This is my first post using **11ty**.

As of right now, I'm trying to set up my site in github pages. Ultimately, I want it to be a cute casual place where I just post my projects and talk about stuff. I was really inspired by ohhelloanna.blog and saw it was built with 11ty. I think before that I had only give it a try one time, and it didn't go well. So here I go again, but this time using the aid of ChatGPT to help me through some of the parts I don't understand. I'm also talking shit to it because it's giving me wrong directions.
It's kinda crazy going through this process as a relative beginner because I have to try to figure out which parts are wrong and which parts are okay.
Like ChatGPT gave me a template for the index and post pages (njk files) and I had no idea it had nunjucks formatting for the date, so I was getting errors when trying to post. And it turns out I have to put in some sort of nunjucks filter to get that date to display correctly.
Right now, I really just want to make sure my css is displaying properly in the credits.html page. Like I can't get it??
