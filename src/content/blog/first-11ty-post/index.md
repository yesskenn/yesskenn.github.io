Welcome, happy to have you here! This is my first post using **11ty**.

As of right now, I'm trying to set up my site in github pages. Ultimately, I want it to be a cute casual place where I just post my projects and talk about stuff. I was really inspired by ohhelloanna.blog and saw it was built with 11ty. I think before that I had only give it a try one time, and it didn't go well. So here I go again, but this time using the aid of ChatGPT to help me through some of the parts I don't understand. I'm also talking shit to it because it's giving me wrong directions.
It's kinda crazy going through this process as a relative beginner because I have to try to figure out which parts are wrong and which parts are okay.
Like ChatGPT gave me a template for the index and post pages (njk files) and I had no idea it had nunjucks formatting for the date, so I was getting errors when trying to post. And it turns out I have to put in some sort of nunjucks filter to get that date to display correctly.

### **11.11.2025**

It's been not that long since August, but I've moved on from 11ty (which was great and simple, 10/10 would use again) and trying out Astro, which is really cool and there's lots of starter themes. I'm using [Astro Sphere] (<https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-sphere>), and I've tried out Incluud's [Accessible Astro Starter] (<https://github.com/incluud/accessible-astro-starter>) - which isn't for me.
SO NOW, I will be going through my content and posts to adapt everything for deployment for my website with the Sphere theme.... here I go!
