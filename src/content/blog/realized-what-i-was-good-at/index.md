DISCLAIMER: I wrote this when I thought I'd be a great graphic designer because I loved art. Turns out I'm better suited for web design and digital communications and accessibility as a whole.

To be honest, I've actually been attempting to make it as a graphic designer (and an artist) for at least 10 years now. A lot of times I keep thinking that this road is probably not for me, but when I start looking for alternatives on Indeed or LinkedIn there's really nothing I'd rather do than create something cool on Illustrator and make things happen.  

In kindergarten, I remember being amazed at one of my classmates because one of his drawings was so good. It was a picture of a tree. That's how I feel most of the time, being in awe at all the amazing art I see. When it comes to my own work, I'm often paralyzed by the "I'm not good enough" thing. I really do believe that I have a good sense of aesthetics, an eye for trends, and a vibe that just hits different. When it comes to execution though, I feel that I'm still very much at that junior level and have SO MUCH to learn. And yeah, I've tiptoed around that level for 10 years but my progress has been slow and steady (more on that on another post) -- and more importantly, it's **progress**.  
  
At least that's what I have to tell myself when I've had an "I'm not good enough" day like today. So, I currently work as an independent contractor / freelance designer most often for a small firm that focuses on corporate communications. I love it because I get to work on different kinds of projects and I'm learning about designing print and digital materials for marketing and internal comms. Yeah, I'm happy that I GET to learn about that stuff and yeah I still don't feel that I've _made it_ (both can be true). _However_, one of the cons is that I feel confused by the direction or that I'm not meeting the expectations. For example, on Tuesday I was given the task of designing two covers for an annual report to be presented on Thursday. It's for a pretty big client and I was very excited about it. I was given different examples of other annual reports to use as a reference, past annual reports, and I was told to do research and gather information on current design trends to use as inspiration. So I did just that, or so I thought.  
I submitted a few drafts that day and re-worked a few drafts the next day. The later half of the day was spent doing a back and forth on Slack going over ONE of the covers by literally following certain instructions to a T ("move the rectangle down so that it bleeds", "make the text stacked", "add a line") Although I do appreciate that this particular feedback made the design better overall, it felt very much like I was getting my hand held which made me feel that I didn't know what I was doing. I know that feedback is necessary and there's always room for improvement, I just wish that I had a clearer vision of what the client wanted in the first place; it definitely wasn't anything resembling general design trends of 2022. So now it's Thursday and I haven't heard anything from anyone, radio silence. I think it means that I didn't do a good enough job (and there it is again).  
What I can do right now is take a break, focus on the cheesecake that I'm currently baking, and work on one of my paintings that is just dying to be finished.  
If anyone comes across this and has any advice on how to move forward and keep progressing as a designer, I'd really love to hear it. Cheesecake baking tips are welcome too.
