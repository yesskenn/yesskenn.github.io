## WEB DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

My front-end dev skills come in handy at the State of California, where I imbue functionality into each form, and craft for a flowing digital experience as an a11y.

I enjoy solving problems as I code. The following are some projects I have worked on —

### Star Wars API Project
