## SEEK HIGHER GROUND

### PROJECT TYPE: GRAPHIC DESIGN**

I really enjoy those t-shirts that you get when you go to a specific place because they sometimes feature unique art. They should be special because you only get them at that specific place. Utah is a very special place to me but unfortunately, I failed to get a t-shirt when I was actually there -- so I created my own.

I initially painted an acrylic painting of the Timpanogos Mountains in Orem. Later on made a digital version of it in Illustrator. I chose the rejected slogan “Seek Higher Ground” instead of the official one (“Life Elevated”) because I like to root for the underdogs and because I feel it fits better with the illustration and what Utah means to me - refuge and a "peak" at the new things to come. And no, the photos will never do that landscape justice.
