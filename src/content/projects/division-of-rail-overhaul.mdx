# **CALTRANS WEBPAGE REDESIGN**

## **OVERVIEW**

**The Division of Rail pages needed a full refresh and several new pages to improve clarity and usability. I led this project from start to finish – coordinating with stakeholders, organizing content, and building components in HTML/CSS – making it easier for users to find what they needed.**
