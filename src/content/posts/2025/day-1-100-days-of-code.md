Okay so more like my first time recording what it and intentionally sharing what I have learned. I am documenting what I learn and build starting with C++, JavaScript, and web development tools.

## How I'm learning right now

So I'm currently taking a programming class at my local community college, with a focus on C++. We are using [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/) to write and test out our code. This is actually my second time taking this course; the first time I took it, I failed. Right now, I have a solid A and there are 6 weeks left in the semester. I think what's different is that this professor is having us learn programming and logic rather than jumping straight into code. For example, for each assignment she gives us a prompt and we have to write out the pseudocode and create a flowchart of our solution. The code itself is optional. Writing out the pseudocode allows us to think about what steps we want to go through with our solution and eventually come out with a design that works. I love this approach and it works for me.  
  
At the same time, I'm jumping back into JavaScript. I started the Odin project in 2020 but I always got stuck on the JavaScript portion. I didn't get the logic that I was supposed to apply to solving those problems. Now that I understand programming logic a bit better, I'm working through the exercises in The Odin Project but also going through Mozilla's Learn curriculum. Yes, this is low-cost and yes, this is the way. Just an FYI, today I'm refreshing my memory on strings, operators, and useful string methods.

Over the last few days, I've decided that for accountability purposes I will be following this 3-step process everyday. Learn, Code, Write About It. I can't wait to look back and see what I've learned and created.

## What I'm learning right now

Oh oh oh, I'm also working on getting certified as a DHS Trusted Tester. This ties in with my job since I'm a web and digital compliance analyst. This means that I make sure that stuff that goes on the my organizations external web pages are is accessible. Accessibility is the right thing to do!

Once I'm done with that I'll be working on getting my CPACC and WAS certifications. It's important to keep accessibility in mind when designing and coding because you want as many people as possible to be able to access what you're putting out there.

So yeah, like I mentioned before I'm refreshing my memory on some basic JavaScript concepts. Like a string property is an attribute that describes the characters of a string. A string method are actions that can be performed on strings.

### Useful String Methods

| **.length** | checks the length of the string |
| --- | --- |
| **slice()** | extracts a section of an object and returns it as a new object |
| **includes()** | comes back as true if an array contains a specific value |
| **indexOf()** | finds the position of the first occurrence of a specified value |

## Takeaways

Right now, I'm having the most fun with JavaScript. Now that everything is starting to click, I'm have a lot of "Aha!" moments. I don't plan on using C++ a lot for web development, but I'm enjoying connecting the dots between the two languages and just getting my hands dirty building small programs.  

What's really being a time-suck, and a suck in general, is the DHS Trusted Tester program. It's a free program meant to certify federal workers as having the knowledge needed to test web accessibility standards. I don't have a problem with the standards themselves, but I do have a problem with the test questions and test environment. More on this later. Let's just say that I'm on my third practice exam.

Next time, I'm going to continue with more JavaScript - focusing on arrays.

I hope these words will be helpful to someone someday along their journey.
