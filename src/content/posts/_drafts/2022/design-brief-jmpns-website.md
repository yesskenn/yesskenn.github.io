## OVERVIEW

JMPNS is a parent participation preschool located in West Sacramento. Under the leadership of Mrs. Hinton, director and teacher, the parents work together to take care of and run the school. Parents rely on the website to stay up to date on events, download required forms, refresh their memories on the procedures, and more. Prospective parents scour the site for as much information as possible to figure out if they would like to enroll their child in the school.

### VALUES

> “…a place for learning, playing, and growing - for the entire family.”
> 
> www.jmpns.org

“As we believe that parents are the child’s first and most important teachers, James Marshall provides an opportunity for parents and formal teachers to come together to guide a child’s early learning experience. It has proven to be a place where both parents and children can learn about themselves and others in an environment designed for growth and exploration.”

### TARGET AUDIENCE

Parents or caregivers of children between the ages of 2yrs/9mos and 5 years old that live in the Sacramento area. Both current and prospective families.  
What they care about:  
• their children,  
• quality education for their children,  
• and peace of mind.

### TONE AND IMAGE

#### • CHILDLIKE WONDER • FUN • PLAYFUL • COMMUNITY

### PROBLEMS

The typeface, colors, and content all do their jobs in conveying what the website is all about. However, its easy to get lost trying to find a certain piece of information and some parts may be harder to read. Most of the content seems to be lumped under the “About” tab, which makes sense but perhaps “Tuition and Fees” could go under “Enrollment”.  
Other things to consider:  
• The website is dense and packed full of information (we do want all the information though).  
• Not very mobile-friendly.  
• Broken links, links go to wrong pages.  
• The footer text is hard to read (not very accessible).

### PROPOSAL

A website that is uncluttered and easy to navigate is needed. We will optimize the mobile version of the site with the goal of improving the overall responsiveness. We will re-organize information architecture and improve the layout to make current content easier to find and easier to read.  
Add new features:  
• a page dedicated to a blog  
• more information about the board of directors  
• a history section for alumni  
• an events calendar

Specific visual goals:  
• uncluttered  
• modern  
• colorful (using JMPNS logo colors)
