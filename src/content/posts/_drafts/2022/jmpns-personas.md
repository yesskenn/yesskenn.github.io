Empathizing with users is the first and foremost principle of designing for user experience. If you can't put yourself in their shoes, then you can't design for them. This was very much a creative thinking exercise and trying to figure out the motivations behind each person who might visit the JMPNS site. These are fictional users, and ideally, these personas would be based on facts and data gathered through user research. In this case, I had my own experience as a JMPNS parent and talking to other JMPNS parents.
