# BRANDING: MILKY WAy

During a time when I was working on some sharp corporate design projects, I decided to take part in a fun branding challenge proposed by an Instagram account, The Brief Collective. The brief called for a logo, secondary logo, some patterns, and additional collateral for a fictional restaurant called "The Milky Way". I enjoy creating bold, colorful, and _wavy_ designs so this was a good way to let some of that out.

To do this I used Adobe Illustrator to create an initial mark, decide on a color palette that reminded me of bubble-gum ice cream, and went to town putting together patterns and type on various art boards. I downloaded mockups from Freepik and tried a few out in Photoshop.
