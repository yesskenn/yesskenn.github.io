Although I'm a graphic and web designer for a living, I also have a few aquarium tanks at home. It's another way to explore my creativity and they're fun and calming to look at.

## **Start Setting Up**

1. Make sure you have a good spot for where the tank will go. Dust it out or set up your stand.

3. Rinse out the aquarium and install your background if you have one.

5. Place the tank where you want it and pour out the substrate.

7. Place the filter and heater in the tank - then add decorations.

9. Fill the aquarium with water at room temperature and dose with the dechlorinator. Follow the instructions on the bottle for dosage.

11. Plant the aquarium plants. You may choose to plant them right in the substrate or in their own separate glass containers ( a lot can be found on **[Amazon](https://a.co/d/26ZHwne)**). You can even superglue them to rocks!  

7. Install the lid and light. The heater needs time to adjust to the water so wait 30 minutes before turning on the equipment.

9. Make sure everything is working properly and that no leaks appear.

11. This is when you can start cycling your aquarium. Cycling the aquarium means to start growing beneficial bacteria or live plants that make the tank a safe environment for fish to live in.  For more information visit [**Aquarium Co-op**](https://www.aquariumcoop.com/blogs/aquarium/fish-tank-cycling).

13. Once you've given enough time for the tank to cycle, you can add fish! You may want to choose fish that generally get along well. There are a few that will each other or simply be aggressive. For example, a betta fish does better along or with fish that It can't catch.

## **Choosing Residents**

**Plants**  
Start with easy, slow-growing plants that don't require a lot of light  
Some of these are:

- Java Fern

- Vallisneria

- Amazon swords

**Fish**

_Mystery snails_ are really fun to observe and they are very low-maintenance. They come in all kinds of colors.  
Schooling fish such as _tetras_ and _endlers_ are also great fish to keep. Some of my favorites are actually _Cory catfish_.
