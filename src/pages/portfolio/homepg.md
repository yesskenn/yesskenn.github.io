## **_A little more about me_**

I am a (perpetually in progress) creative web developer. I specialize in building intuitive / accessible websites with clear structure and expressive depth. I tend to romanticize code and I love aesthetics that make me feel something.  
When I'm not making things on the internet, I'm probably organizing my notes, tweaking a color palette, and being inspired by streetlights, flowers, and cute cartoons or video games.
