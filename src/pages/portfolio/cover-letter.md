Graphic & Web Designer

## **TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:**

Hello, my name is Yessi and I’m excited to apply for the web designer position. My past work experience and diverse skill set directly correlate with the duties required of this role and I believe I am well prepared to take this on. Currently, I’m working as a freelance graphic designer with a studio that focuses on corporate communications. Here, I work closely with the Senior Designer to ensure that the client needs and requirements for each project are met and well-executed. My regular duties include producing graphic assets for different clients including social media graphics, brochures, trade show deliverables, and other promotional and marketing materials. For each unique design, I make sure to maintain the brand identity and meet client guidelines - skills that I would also use as a web designer. In the past, I’ve proven I have great organizational and multi-tasking skills as well as the ability to work independently in a collaborative environment.

My role at Venture Data, a market research firm focusing on voter polls, has allowed me to develop a solid foundation in leadership and management skills, in addition to adapting to a fast-paced environment with multiple moving parts. As a supervisor, I provided feedback, technical instruction, and guidance to others. Later on, I became a shift manager. I managed daily projects and personnel resources, keeping confidential information secure, continuously monitoring data sample, and making decisions to meet specific quotas, deadlines, and client guidelines. Of course, I took on other administrative duties wherever needed, including working the front desk and respond to inquiries, and translating political surveys from English to Spanish. This was collaborative environment in which I discussed with my peers, department leaders, and other stakeholders to determine what the best course of action will be for each given day. I have obtained a Bachelor’s degree in art and design.

My education has allowed me to develop the technical skills to become proficient in Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, HTML/ CSS, and more. I’ve also developed a meticulous eye for design but more importantly, I’ve learned to conduct thorough research and ask the right questions to get tasks done. My design background has taught me to constantly evaluate and self-edit my work to maintain correctness and completeness. In addition, I'm in the process of completing a UI and Web Design certificate.

My experience, analytical mind, and broad skillset are valuable in fulfilling the duties of the web designer. I would love to continue growing my passion for design and as a professional at your company. Thank you for reading and I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely, Yessi K
